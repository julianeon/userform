# User Form

## Overview

![upload_form_working](upload_form_working.png)

This one-page TypeScript app accepts user input and uploads the data to an API endpoint.

If your endpoint works, and the fields match, you'll be able to save the data. Confirmed to work with my own personal API endpoint (not included).

## Features

This app is written in TypeScript, in React. It shows a form where the user can enter their data, press Submit, and send it to the API. 

If the submission is successful, the user will be told 'thank you' and that the owner will be in touch. If not, the reason for the failure is given.

To compare to similar JavaScript code in React serving the same purpose, see this [gist](https://gist.github.com/julianeon/767e32fc069d0a1568683deb4dd31fb0) and [this article](https://javascriptpage.com/make-an-email-submit-form-with-javascript) explaining it.

## How to Run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
